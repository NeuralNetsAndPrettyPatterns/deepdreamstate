## About the Series

Deep Dream State is a narrative audio series exploring hypnosis, sound design, and the boundaries between dream and story. Three narrative arcs unfold across 25 episodes of experimental audio drama.

- **Arc 1: The Chthonic** — A luxury cruise with a wedding party sails into an older ceremony. Archaeology, vows, and sea gods turn the ship into ritual.
- **Arc 2: Incognitoh** — A reality competition rewrites its players. Surveillance is constant, alliances are leverage, and the game keeps playing back.
- **Arc 3: Sitri Center** — A secluded dream institute offers participants a chance to master their dreams. But once the experiment begins, control becomes illusion.
