## About the Series

*Deep Dream State* is a narrative audio drama exploring hypnosis, sound design, and the blurred boundary between dream, control, and story. The series unfolds across multiple narrative arcs, each structured as a self-contained experiment within a shared fictional framework.

The show examines why systems of control can feel pleasurable, comforting, or desirable — even when they are unsettling.

### Narrative Arcs

- **Arc 1: Chthonic**  
  A luxury cruise wedding party drifts into an older ceremony. Archaeology, vows, and submerged gods turn the ship into a ritual space where individual will dissolves.

- **Arc 2: Incognitoh**  
  A reality competition reshapes its contestants from the inside out. Surveillance becomes a mechanism of transformation, and performance replaces identity.

- **Arc 3: Sitri Center**  
  A secluded dream research institute promises mastery over the unconscious. Therapeutic language masks a system where empowerment and control become indistinguishable.

Additional arcs are in development.
